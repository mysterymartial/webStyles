\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 What is a Software Architecture?\par
Software Architecture is a high-level structure of the software system that includes the set of rules, patterns, and guidelines that dictate the organization, interactions, and the component relationships. It serves as blueprint ensuring that the system meets its requirements and it is maintainable and scalable.\par
\par
Modularity: Software Architecture divides system into interchangeable components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.\par
Encapsulation: It helps to hide the details of the components, exposing only the necessary information, thus reducing the complexity of the system.\par
Security: It helps to incorporate measures to protect the system against the unauthorized access.\par
Documentation: Provides clear documentation of the system architecture, thus facilitating communication and better understanding of the system.\par
Performance: Software architecture helps to make sure that the system meets the required performance metrics such as resource utilization, throughput, etc.\par

Types of Software Architecture Patterns\par
1. Layered Architecture Pattern\par
As the name suggests, components(code) in this pattern are separated into layers of subtasks and they are arranged one above another. Each layer has unique tasks to do and all the layers are independent of one another. Since each layer is independent, one can modify the code inside a layer without affecting others. It is the most commonly used pattern for designing the majority of software. This layer is also known as \lquote N-tier architecture\rquote . Basically, this pattern has 4 layers.  \par
\par
Presentation layer: The user interface layer where we see and enter data into an application.)\par
Business layer: This layer is responsible for executing business logic as per the request.)\par
Application layer: This layer acts as a medium for communication between the \lquote presentation layer\rquote  and \lquote data layer\rquote .\par
Data layer: This layer has a database for managing data.)\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Scalability: Individual layers in the architecture can be scaled independently to meet performance needs.\par
Flexibility: Different technologies can be used within each layer without affecting others.\par
Maintainability: Changes in one layer do not necessarily impact other layers, thus simplifying the maintenance.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
\par
\par
Complexity: Adding more layers to the architecture can make the system more complex and difficult to manage.\par
Performance Overhead: Multiple layers can introduce latency due to additional communication between the layers.\par
Strict Layer Separation: Strict layer separation can sometimes lead to inefficiencies and increased development effort.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
Enterprise Applications like Customer Relationship Management (CRM).\par
Web Applications like E-commerce platforms.\par
Desktop Applications such as Financial Software.\par
Mobile Applications like Banking applications.\par
Content Management Systems like WordPress.\par
2. Client-Server Architecture Pattern\par
The client-server pattern has two major entities. They are a server and multiple clients. Here the server has resources(data, files or services) and a client requests the server for a particular resource. Then the server processes the request and responds back accordingly.\par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Centralized Management: Servers can centrally manage resources, data, and security policies, thus simplifying the maintenance.\par
Scalability: Servers can be scaled up to handle increased client requests.\par
Security: Security measures such as access controls, data encryption can be implemented in a better way due to centralized controls.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Single Point of Failure: Due to centralized server, if server fails clients lose access to services, leading loss of productivity.\par
Costly: Setting up and maintaining servers can be expensive due to hardware, software, and administrative costs.\par
Complexity: Designing and managing a client-server architecture can be complex.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
Web Applications like Amazon.\par
Email Services like Gmail, Outlook.\par
File Sharing Services like Dropbox, Google Drive.\par
Media Streaming Services like Netflix.\par
Education Platforms like Moodle.\par
3. Event-Driven Architecture Pattern\par
Event-Driven Architecture is an agile approach in which services (operations) of the software are triggered by events. When a user takes action in the application built using the EDA approach, a state change happens and a reaction is generated that is called an event.\par
\par
Example:\par
\par
A new user fills the signup form and clicks the signup button on Facebook and then a FB account is created for him, which is an event.\par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Scalability: System can scale horizontally by adding more consumers.\par
Real-time Processing: This enables real-time processing and immediate response to events.\par
Flexibility: New event consumers can be added without modifying existing components.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
\par
\par
Complexity: The architecture can be complex to design, implement, and debug.\par
Complex Testing: Testing event-driven systems can be complicated compared to synchronous systems.\par
Reliability: Ensuring reliability requires additional mechanisms to handle failed events.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
Real-Time Analytics like stock market analysis systems.\par
IoT Applications like smart home systems.\par
Financial Systems like fraud detection systems monitor transactions in real-time.\par
Online multiplayer games.\par
Customer Support Systems like Chatbots.\par
4. Microkernel Architecture Pattern\par
Microkernel pattern has two major components. They are a core system and plug-in modules. \par
\par
The core system handles the fundamental and minimal operations of the application.\par
The plug-in modules handle the extended functionalities (like extra features) and customized processing.\par
Let\rquote s imagine, you have successfully built a chat application. And the basic functionality of the app is that you can text with people across the world without an internet connection. After some time, you would like to add a voice messaging feature to the application, then you are adding the feature successfully. You can add that feature to the already developed application because the microkernel pattern facilitates you to add features as plug-ins.  \par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Flexibility: New functionalities can be added easily through plug-ins.\par
Scalability: The system can scale by adding more plug-ins to handle more tasks.\par
Maintainability: Plug-ins are developed and tested independently which makes maintenance easier.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Complex Communication: Managing communication between the core systems and plug-ins can be complex.\par
Lack Built-in Functionalities: Due to minimalistic design the basic functionalities are absent that are common in monolithic architectures.\par
Complex Design: Designing the microkernel and its communication mechanisms can be challenging.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
Operating Systems like Windows NT and macOS.\par
Embedded Systems like Automotive Software Systems.\par
Plugin-based Applications like Eclipse IDE.\par
5. Microservices Architecture Pattern\par
The collection of small services that are combined to form the actual application is the concept of microservices pattern. Instead of building a bigger application, small programs are built for every service (function) of an application independently. And those small programs are bundled together to be a full-fledged application. So adding new features and modifying existing microservices without affecting other microservices are no longer a challenge when an application is built in a microservices pattern. Modules in the application of microservices patterns are loosely coupled. So they are easily understandable, modifiable and scalable.  \par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Scalability: Each service can be scaled independently based on demand.\par
Faster Delivery: Independent services allows teams to develop, test, and deploy features faster.\par
Easier Maintenance: Services can be updated and maintained independently.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Complex Management: Managing multiple services requires robust monitoring and management tools.\par
Network Congestion: Increased network traffic between services can lead to congestion and overhead.\par
Security: Securing multiple services and their communication increases the probability of attack.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
E-commerce Platforms like Amazon and eBay.\par
Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify.\par
Online Banking Platforms.\par
Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems.\par
Social Media Platforms like Twitter and Facebook.\par
6. Space-Based Architecture Pattern\par
Space-Based Architecture Pattern is also known as Cloud-Based or Grid-Based Architecture Pattern. It is designed to address the scalability issues associated with large-scale and high-traffic applications. This pattern is built around the concept of shared memory space that is accessed by multiple nodes.\par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Scalability: The system can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more processing units.\par
Performance: In-memory data grids reduces the data access latency.\par
Flexibility: Modular components allow for flexible deployment.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Complexity: Designing and managing distributed system is complex.\par
Cost: The infrastructure for space-based architecture pattern requires multiple servers and advanced middleware, which can be expensive.\par
Network Latency: Communication between distributed components can introduce network latency.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
E-commerce Platforms like Amazon.\par
Telecom Service Providers.\par
Multiplayer Online Games.\par
7. Master-Slave Architecture Pattern\par
The Master-Slave Architecture Pattern is also known as Primary-Secondary Architecture. It involves a single master component and that controls multiple slave components. The master components assign tasks to slave components and the slave components report the results of task execution back to the master. This is often used for parallel processing and load distribution.\par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Scalability: The system can scale horizontally by adding more slave units to handle increased load.\par
Fault Tolerance: If slave fails, then the master can reassign the tasks to some another slave. thus enhancing the fault tolerance.\par
Performance: Parallel execution of tasks can improve the performance of the system.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Single Point of Failure: The master component is a single point of failure. If the master fails then the entire system can collapse.\par
Complex Communication: The communication overhead between master and slave can be significant especially in large systems.\par
Latency: Systems\rquote  responsiveness can be affected by the latency introduced by master-slave communication.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
Database Replication.\par
Load Balancing.\par
Sensor Networks.\par
Backup and Recovery Systems.\par
8. Pipe-Filter Architecture Pattern\par
Pipe-Filter Architecture Pattern structures a system around a series of processing elements called filters that are connected by pipes. Each filter processes data and passes it to the next filter via pipe.\par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Reusability: Filters can be reused in different pipelines or applications.\par
Scalability: Additional filters can be added to extend the functionality to the pipeline.\par
Parallelism: Filters can be executed in parallel if they are stateless, thus improving performance.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Debugging Difficulty: Identifying and debugging issues are difficult in long pipelines.\par
Data Format constraints: Filters must agree on the data format, requiring careful design and standardization.\par
Latency: Data must be passed through multiple filters, which can introduce latency.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
Data Processing Pipelines like Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes in data warehousing.\par
Compilers.\par
Stream-Processing like Apache Flink.\par
Image and Signal Processing.\par
9. Broker Architecture Pattern\par
The Broker architecture pattern is designed to manage and facilitate communication between decoupled components in a distributed system. It involves a broker that acts as a intermediary to route the requests to the appropriate server.\par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Scalability: Brokers support horizontal scaling by adding more servers to handle increased load.\par
Flexibility: New servers can be added and the existing ones can be removed or modified without impacting the entire system.\par
Fault Tolerance: If a server fails, then broker can route the request to another server.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Complex Implementation: Implementing a broker requires robust management of routing and load balancing, thus make system more complex.\par
Single Point of Failure: If broker is not designed with failover mechanisms then it can become a single point of failure.\par
Security Risks: Securing broker component is important to prevent potential vulnerabilities.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
Integration of various enterprise applications like CRM, ERP, and HR systems.\par
Systems using message brokers like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.\par
Sensor networks in IoT applications.\par
10. Peer-to-Peer Architecture Pattern\par
The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture pattern is a decentralized network model where each node, known as a peer, acts as both a client and a server. There is no central authority or single point of control in P2P architecture pattern. Peers can share resources, data, and services directly with each other.\par
\par
Advantages:\par
\par
Scalability: The network can scale easily as more peers join.\par
Fault Tolerance: As data is replicated across multiple peers, this results in system being resilient to failures.\par
Cost Efficiency: There is no need for centralized servers, thus reducing the infrastructure cost.\par
Disadvantages:\par
\par
Security Risks: Decentralized nature of the architecture makes it difficult to enforce security policies.\par
Data Consistency: Ensuring data consistency across peers can be challenging.\par
Complex Management: Managing a decentralized network with numerous independent peers can be complex.\par
Use Cases:\par
\par
File Sharing like BitTorrent Protocol.\par
Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\par
VoIP and Communication like Skype.\par
